### Projects

[Genome Classification using Recurrent Neural Networks](notebooks/UCI_splice_tutorial_h)
Tutorial I made for other members of the lab to help them with preprocessing genome sequences. A simple LSTM RNN is demonstrated on the preprocessed data to classify the sequences.

[Robot Vision and Mapping](/pdf/RoboticsPresentation.pdf)
Computer vision task of using 3D video feed from mobile robot to detect colored object, return object location in the mapped space, orient robot, and grab with robot arm.

[Image Reconstruction Using Sparse Approximation](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
Reconstructed greyscale images from binary half-tone images. This was done using task specific dictionary learning and sparse reconstruction of image patches to minimize peak signal-to-noise ratio.
