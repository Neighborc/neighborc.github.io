### Projects

[Masters Thesis Defense: Minimum Complexity Echo State Networks For Genome and Sequence Analysis](pdf/Chris_MastersThesisSlides_FinalVersion)


In this work echo state networks, a form of recurrent neural networks, were explored with the motivation that their implementation in DNA would be more feasible. Echo state networks consist of a fixed recurrent hidden layer, called the reservoir, with a trainable linear readout layer. We explored the size and sparsity of these networks with an aim for minimum complexity, small size and fewer connections, while still achieving improvements over linear baseline models.

[Genome Classification using Recurrent Neural Networks](notebooks/UCI_splice_tutorial_h)


Tutorial I made for other members of the lab to help them with preprocessing genome sequences. A simple LSTM RNN is demonstrated on the preprocessed data to classify the sequences.

[Art Style Transfer using Convolutional Neural Networks](pdf/StyleTransfer_FinalPresentation.pdf)


Used various CNN models for art style transfer from metal music albums to common brand logos

[Robot Vision and Mapping](/pdf/RoboticsPresentation.pdf)


Computer vision task of using 3D video feed from mobile robot to detect colored object, return object location in the mapped space, orient robot, and grab with robot arm.

[Image Reconstruction Using Sparse Approximation](/pdf/sparse_image_reconstruction_project.pdf)


Reconstructed greyscale images from binary half-tone images. This was done using task specific dictionary learning and sparse reconstruction of image patches to minimize peak signal-to-noise ratio.

[Unemployment Rate Prediction and Seasonal Adjustment](/pdf/UnemploymentPresentation.pdf)


Modeled USA unemployment rates using moving average and adaptive linear models on time-series data.
